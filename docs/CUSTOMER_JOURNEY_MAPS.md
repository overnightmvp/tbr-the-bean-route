### Stage 1: Awareness

- **Pain Point:** Is it worth my time to list?

### Stage 2: Registration (`/vendors/register`)
- **Action:** Multi-step application submission.
- **Barrier:** 30+ character description requirement; Multiple choice suburbs.
- **Gap:** No way to show off their setup (Images).

### Stage 3: The Wait
- **Trigger:** Application Received email.
- **Pain Point:** 24hr review cycle is "dead time" without a dashboard.

### Stage 4: Activation
- **Trigger:** Admin Approval → Welcome Email.
- **Result:** Listing goes live on `/app`.
