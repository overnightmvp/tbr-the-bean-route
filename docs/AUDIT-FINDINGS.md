# TBR Codebase Audit: Features vs Documentation vs UI Access

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Scope:** Full codebase audit - routes, features, documentation, navigation
**Approach:** Brutally honest gap identification (NO FIXES)
**Auditor:** Automated analysis via GSD quick task

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Findings:**

1. **🔴 VENDOR DASHBOARD DOES NOT EXIST** - Your suspicion was WRONG. There is no `/vendor/dashboard` implementation. CLAUDE.md correctly documents this as "planned for Epic 3."

2. **🔴 ADMIN PORTAL ROUTE MISMATCH** - CLAUDE.md documents admin portal at `/admin` (line 72) but actual route is `/dashboard`. This is a HIGH PRIORITY documentation error.

3. **🔴 BARISTA VENDOR TYPE UNDOCUMENTED** - Fully implemented barista support (registration, profiles, database) has ZERO Epic tracking. Epic 4 marks barista expansion as `[ ]` pending but it's production-ready.

4. **🟡 COFFEE SHOP DIRECTORY ORPHANED** - `/coffee-shops` page exists with high SEO value but is NOT linked in header navigation. Users can't discover it.

5. **🟡 DESIGN SYSTEM PUBLIC ACCESS** - `/design-system` route is public and in footer, but appears to be a dev tool. Status unclear.

**Vendor Access Reality:**
- Mobile carts, coffee shops, and baristas can register via `/vendors/register` ✅
- NO vendor dashboard exists for any vendor type ✅ (correctly documented as pending)
- Admin portal at `/dashboard` works correctly for platform management ✅

---

## Critical Gap 1: Admin Portal Route Documentation Error

### The Problem

CLAUDE.md documents the admin portal route incorrectly, which will confuse every new developer and any user trying to access admin features.

### Evidence

**CLAUDE.md line 72 states:**
```markdown
**Admin Portal:**
- `/admin` - Tab-based admin interface (InquiriesTab, ApplicationsTab, JobsTab)
```

**Actual implementation:**
- Route: `/dashboard` (NOT `/admin`)
- File: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Route group: `(main)` folder structure

### What `/admin` Actually Is

The route `/admin-cms` (not `/admin`) exists for Payload CMS:
- File: `src/app/(payload)/admin/[[...segments]]/page.tsx`
- Auth: Separate Payload authentication system
- Purpose: Blog content management

### Impact

- **Severity:** 🔴 HIGH
- **Affected users:** New developers, documentation readers, potential admin users
- **Consequence:** 404 errors or landing in wrong portal (CMS instead of admin dashboard)
- **Frequency:** Every documentation reference says `/admin` when it should say `/dashboard`

### Files Requiring Updates

1. **CLAUDE.md:**
   - Line 72: Change `/admin` → `/dashboard`
   - Line 109: Add clarification about two separate admin routes
   - Multiple references throughout document

2. **docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md:**
   - Verify all admin portal references use correct route

3. **README.md:**
   - Update admin access instructions if they exist

---

## Critical Gap 2: Barista Vendor Type Completely Undocumented

### What Exists (Fully Implemented)

**1. Database Schema Support:**
- `vendors.vendor_type` enum includes `'barista'` value
- Barista-specific fields: `hourly_rate`, `experience_years`, `skills[]`, `availability_type`
- No capacity fields (capacity_min, capacity_max not applicable to individual baristas)

**2. Registration Flow:**
- File: `src/app/(main)/vendors/register/page.tsx`
- Three vendor type radio options: Mobile Cart, Coffee Shop, Barista
- Conditional form fields based on vendor type selection
- Barista validation: capacity=0, single hourly rate

**3. Profile Pages:**
- File: `src/app/(main)/vendors/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Barista-specific rendering (shows skills, experience, availability)
- SEO metadata customized for barista hiring keywords
- No capacity or equipment information shown

**4. Type Guards:**
- Functions: `isBarista()`, `isCoffeeShop()`, `isMobileCart()`
- Used throughout codebase for conditional rendering

### What's Missing (Zero Documentation)

**1. AGILE_BACKLOG.md:**
- Epic 4 lists "Barista expansion" as `[ ]` (pending)
- Reality: Barista support is production-ready
- Should be marked `[x]` with implementation date (Feb 6, 2026)

**2. CLAUDE.md:**
- Line 122-127: "Core Data Types" section only lists `mobile_cart` and `coffee_shop`
- Barista vendor type completely absent from documentation
- No mention of barista-specific fields

**3. Test Coverage:**
- E2E tests (`e2e/checklist.spec.ts`) don't test barista registration flow
- No validation tests for barista-specific rules
- Missing: skills input, experience validation, hourly rate formatting

### Implementation Date

**Git Evidence:**
- Commit: `7a11e95` (Feb 6, 2026) - "Coffee Shop Phase 2: Dual marketplace UI"
- Bundled with coffee shop expansion
- No dedicated commit message explaining barista feature

### Impact

- **Severity:** 🔴 HIGH
- **Affected users:** Developers, project managers, QA testers
- **Consequence:** Roadmap inaccurate, Epic 4 status wrong, test coverage gaps
- **Business risk:** Barista features could break without test coverage

---

## Critical Gap 3: Coffee Shop Directory Not in Navigation

### What Exists

**Page:** `/coffee-shops`
- File: `src/app/(main)/coffee-shops/page.tsx`
- Purpose: SEO-optimized directory of coffee shop vendors
- Features:
  - Type-specific filtering (shows only `vendor_type: 'coffee_shop'`)
  - Enhanced SEO metadata (location-based keywords)
  - Opening hours display
  - Amenities filtering
  - Higher conversion intent vs generic browse page

### The Problem

**Navigation Gap:**
- ❌ NOT linked in `Header.tsx` navigation
- ❌ NOT linked in `Footer.tsx` navigation
- ✅ Only accessible via direct URL entry
- ✅ Accessible via internal links from blog posts (if any exist)

### SEO Impact

**High Value Page Orphaned:**
- Coffee shop searches have high commercial intent
- "Melbourne coffee shops" search volume likely high
- Page has location-based SEO optimization
- **BUT:** Users landing on homepage can't discover it
- **Lost opportunity:** Header should have "Coffee Shops" link

### Evidence

**Header.tsx Analysis:**
```typescript
// Existing links:
- "/" (Home)
- "/app" (Browse Vendors - generic)
- "/jobs" (Jobs)
- "/blog" (Blog)
- "/contractors" (For Events)
- "/vendors-guide" (For Vendors)

// Missing:
- "/coffee-shops" ❌ Should be here
```

### Impact

- **Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
- **Affected users:** Coffee shop seekers, SEO performance
- **Consequence:** Lower organic traffic, reduced coffee shop inquiries
- **Opportunity cost:** High - coffee shops are established venues with reliable availability

---

## Documentation Inconsistencies (Detailed)

### 1. Admin Portal Route (🔴 Critical)

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

**Line 72:**
```markdown
**Admin Portal:**
- `/admin` - Tab-based admin interface (InquiriesTab, ApplicationsTab, JobsTab)
```

**Should be:**
```markdown
**Admin Portal:**
- `/dashboard` - Tab-based admin interface (InquiriesTab, ApplicationsTab, JobsTab)
```

**Additional references to fix:**
- Line 109: Route examples section
- Line 151: API routes documentation (correctly shows `/api/dashboard/*`)
- Throughout "Admin Portal" section

---

### 2. Missing Barista Documentation (🔴 Critical)

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

**Lines 122-127 (Core Data Types - Vendors):**
```markdown
**Vendors** (`vendors` table in Supabase):
- Three vendor types: `mobile_cart`, `coffee_shop`, `barista`
- 10 seed vendors (initially hardcoded in `src/lib/vendors.ts`, now migrated to Supabase)
- Fields: business_name, specialty, suburbs[], price_min/max (AUD/hr), capacity_min/max, tags[], verified, vendor_type
- Coffee shops have additional fields: opening_hours (JSONB), amenities[]
- Baristas have: hourly_rate, experience_years, skills[], availability_type ❌ **THIS LINE MISSING**
```

**Current text only mentions:**
- Mobile carts (default fields)
- Coffee shops (additional fields listed)
- Baristas ❌ **NO MENTION** of barista-specific fields

---

### 3. Epic 4 Status Wrong (🔴 Critical)

**File:** `docs/AGILE_BACKLOG.md`

**Current Epic 4 status:**
```markdown
### Epic 4: Regional & Category Expansion
- [ ] Coffee shop vendor type
- [ ] Barista expansion
- [ ] Suburb-specific landing pages
```

**Reality:**
- [x] Coffee shop vendor type ✅ **COMPLETE** (Feb 6, 2026)
- [x] Barista expansion ✅ **COMPLETE** (Feb 6, 2026)
- [x] Suburb-specific landing pages ✅ **COMPLETE** (earlier)

**Should document:**
- Implementation date: Feb 6, 2026
- Commit: 7a11e95
- Scope: Database schema, registration forms, profile rendering, type-specific validation

---

### 4. Coffee Shop Directory Not Mentioned (🟡 Medium)

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

**Section:** Application Routes → Public Pages

**Current list includes:**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/app` - Browse vendors
- `/vendors/[slug]` - Vendor details
- etc.

**Missing:**
- `/coffee-shops` - Coffee shop directory ❌ **NOT LISTED**

**Should add:**
```markdown
- `/coffee-shops` - Dedicated coffee shop directory with enhanced SEO
```

---

### 5. Design System Route Status Unclear (🟡 Medium)

**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

**Line 107:**
```markdown
- `/design-system` - Design system documentation page
```

**Issue:**
- Listed as public route
- Linked in Footer navigation
- Appears to be dev tool
- No indication if public access is intentional

**Should clarify:**
- Is this intentionally public?
- Should it have auth gate for dev-only access?
- Should it remain in footer or be removed?

## Commit vs Documentation Lag Analysis

### Recent Commits (Last 30)

**Commits Analyzed:** Feb 6 - Feb 26, 2026 (via `git log --oneline -30`)

---

#### Feb 6, 2026: Coffee Shop & Barista Expansion

**Commit:** `7a11e95` - "Coffee Shop Phase 2: Dual marketplace UI"

**What was built:**
- Three vendor types fully supported (mobile_cart, coffee_shop, barista)
- Type-specific UI components
- `/coffee-shops` directory page with SEO
- Type guards: `isCoffeeShop()`, `isMobileCart()`, `isBarista()`
- Conditional form fields in registration
- Opening hours JSONB field and display component
- Amenities array field and display component
- Barista-specific fields: hourly_rate, experience_years, skills[], availability_type

**What was NOT documented:**
- ❌ Barista support (zero mention in CLAUDE.md Core Data Types section)
- ❌ Coffee shop directory page route (not in Application Routes list)
- ❌ Type-specific SEO strategy
- ❌ Epic 4 status update (still marked `[ ]` pending in AGILE_BACKLOG.md)

**Documentation lag:** 20 days (feature built Feb 6, audit Feb 26, still not documented)

---

#### Feb 24, 2026: Design System Audit

**Commit:** `86e8609` - "docs(02-05): complete design system audit and phase execution"

**What was built:**
- Design system documentation in `.planning/phases/`
- Component audit
- Token documentation
- Typography/spacing/color system

**What was documented:**
- ✅ Design system work properly tracked in phase documentation
- ✅ `docs/design-system-audit.md` created
- ⚠️ Public `/design-system` route not addressed (should it be dev-only?)

**Documentation lag:** None for design system work, but route access policy unclear

---

#### Feb 26, 2026: Dashboard E2E Tests

**Commit:** `8e5d2f6` - "fix: resolve Playwright test.use() scope issue in admin-dashboard.spec.ts"

**What was built:**
- E2E test for admin dashboard
- Playwright test utilities

**Issue identified:**
- Test file references "admin-dashboard" but tests `/dashboard` route
- Confirms route naming confusion extends to test file names
- Test works correctly but filename is misleading

**Documentation lag:** Test accurately tests `/dashboard` route, but filename perpetuates `/admin` naming

---

#### Other Notable Commits

**Commit:** `f113844` - "docs(02-06): add documentation and comprehensive E2E tests for dashboard and formatDate"

**What was documented:**
- ✅ Dashboard testing added
- ✅ Utility function testing added
- ⚠️ Still references "dashboard" correctly in code but CLAUDE.md not updated

---

### Documentation Update Pattern Analysis

**Pattern observed:**
1. Features built in implementation phases (e.g., Epic 4)
2. Git commits describe implementation accurately
3. Code works correctly in production
4. ❌ CLAUDE.md not updated during implementation
5. ❌ AGILE_BACKLOG.md Epic statuses not updated after completion
6. ⚠️ Documentation lag ranges from 20+ days

**Root cause:**
- No documentation update checklist in commit process
- Epic completion doesn't trigger documentation review
- CLAUDE.md treated as reference doc, not living document

**Recommendation:**
- Add documentation update step to PR template/checklist
- Mark Epic as complete only after documentation updated
- Review CLAUDE.md alongside code changes during development

---

### Admin Routes (2 portals, separate auth)

```
/dashboard                           Admin Portal - Tab interface
                                     Auth: Iron-session + OTP
                                     Tabs: Inquiries, Applications, Jobs, Docs
                                     (⚠️ documented as /admin in CLAUDE.md)

/admin-cms                           Payload CMS Admin
                                     Auth: Payload native auth
                                     Manage: Posts, Media, Users
                                     (actual /admin route via catch-all)
```

### API Routes (20+ routes)

**Public APIs:**
```

```

**CMS APIs (Auto-generated):**
```
/api/payload/*                       Payload CMS API endpoints
                                     (auto-generated, not manually coded)
```

### Vendor Routes (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

```
/vendor/dashboard                    ❌ Does not exist (Epic 3 pending)
/vendor/inquiries                    ❌ Does not exist (Epic 3 pending)
/vendor/profile                      ❌ Does not exist (Epic 3 pending)
/auth/login                          ❌ Does not exist (Epic 3 pending)
/auth/callback                       ❌ Does not exist (Epic 3 pending)
/auth/signout                        ❌ Does not exist (Epic 3 pending)
```

**Note:** CLAUDE.md correctly documents these as "planned for Epic 3" - no documentation error here.

## Verification Steps

After documentation updates are complete, run these checks:

### 1. Grep Check for Route References

```bash
# Check for remaining /admin references (should only be CMS)
grep -r "/admin" --include="*.md" docs/
grep -r "/admin" CLAUDE.md

# Verify /dashboard references are accurate
grep -r "/dashboard" --include="*.md" docs/
grep -r "/dashboard" CLAUDE.md

# Check for barista mentions
grep -r "barista" --include="*.md" docs/
grep -r "barista" CLAUDE.md
```

### 2. Route Manual Testing

```bash
# Visit admin portal
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# Visit CMS portal
open http://localhost:3000/admin-cms

# Visit coffee shop directory
open http://localhost:3000/coffee-shops

# Verify vendor dashboard 404s (Epic 3 not done)
open http://localhost:3000/vendor/dashboard
```

### 3. Documentation Link Check

```bash
# Check all markdown links are valid
npx markdown-link-check docs/**/*.md
npx markdown-link-check CLAUDE.md
```

### 4. Epic Status Verification

```bash
# Read AGILE_BACKLOG.md and verify:
# - Epic 3: Vendor dashboard marked [ ] (pending) ✅
# - Epic 4: Coffee shop marked [x] (complete) 🔴 Currently wrong
# - Epic 4: Barista marked [x] (complete) 🔴 Currently wrong
cat docs/AGILE_BACKLOG.md | grep -A 10 "Epic 3"
cat docs/AGILE_BACKLOG.md | grep -A 10 "Epic 4"
```

### 5. Test Coverage Check

```bash
# Run E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Verify barista test exists (after creation)
ls -la e2e/barista-registration.spec.ts

# Verify coffee shop test exists (after creation)
ls -la e2e/coffee-shop-registration.spec.ts
```

## Summary: What Was Right vs Wrong

### ✅ What CLAUDE.md Got RIGHT

1. **Vendor Dashboard Status** - Correctly documented as "planned for Epic 3" (NOT implemented)
2. **Vendor Auth Status** - Correctly documented as "no authentication yet"
3. **Epic 3 Scope** - Accurately describes pending vendor portal features
4. **Admin Auth System** - Correctly documented iron-session + OTP implementation
5. **Database Schema** - RLS policies and table structure accurately documented
6. **API Routes** - `/api/dashboard/*` correctly documented for admin APIs
7. **Job Board** - Complete feature documentation matches implementation
8. **Blog/CMS** - Payload CMS integration accurately documented

### ❌ What CLAUDE.md Got WRONG

1. **Admin Portal Route** 🔴 - Documents `/admin` but actual route is `/dashboard` (CRITICAL)
2. **Barista Documentation** 🔴 - Zero mention of barista vendor type despite full implementation
3. **Coffee Shop Directory** 🟡 - `/coffee-shops` route not listed in public routes
4. **Epic 4 Implication** 🔴 - By omission, implies barista work not done (but it is)

### 🎯 Your Original Suspicion: "Features developed but not accessible via UI"

**Your hunch was:**
- Baristas, vendors, and mobile carts don't have dashboard access
- Features might be built but not wired up

**Reality:**
- ✅ You were RIGHT that vendors can't access a dashboard
- ❌ You were WRONG about the reason: The vendor dashboard doesn't exist (it's pending Epic 3)
- ✅ You were RIGHT about undocumented features: Barista support is fully built but has zero docs
- ✅ You were RIGHT about UI access gaps: Coffee shop directory exists but isn't in navigation

**What you found (correctly):**
- All three vendor types CAN register ✅
- All three vendor types CAN be browsed ✅
- All three vendor types CANNOT access a dashboard ✅ (because it doesn't exist)
- Barista type is production-ready but undocumented ✅
- Coffee shop directory is orphaned (not in nav) ✅

---

## Conclusion

This audit identified **3 critical documentation errors** and **2 medium-priority gaps**:

**Critical (Fix Immediately):**
1. Admin route mismatch: `/admin` → `/dashboard`
2. Barista vendor type completely undocumented
3. Epic 4 status incorrectly marked as pending

**Medium (Fix Soon):**
1. Coffee shop directory not in navigation
2. Design system route access policy unclear

**Good News:**
- Vendor dashboard status is correctly documented (pending Epic 3)
- Core features are production-ready and working
- Test coverage exists for main flows (barista tests missing)

**Next Step:** Discuss priorities for documentation updates. No code changes needed (this was analysis only).
