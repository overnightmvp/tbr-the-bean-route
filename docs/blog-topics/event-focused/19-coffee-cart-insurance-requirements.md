*Red Flag 2: Policy Expired*
- Check expiry date carefully
- If expired: Vendor must renew and provide updated certificate

*Red Flag 3: Wrong Business Name*
- Certificate must match vendor's legal business name
- If name doesn't match: May be invalid (vendor no longer insured)

*Red Flag 4: Coverage Too Low*
- Venue requires $20M, vendor has $5M → inadequate
- Vendor must upgrade coverage or find alternative vendor

**Who to Contact to Verify**
- Insurance company listed on certificate
