### Brand Activation Strategies (600 words)

**Strategy 1: Free Coffee in Exchange for Lead Capture**

*How It Works*
- Guest scans QR code / badge / provides email → receives free coffee
- CRM integration captures lead data
- Follow-up marketing campaign post-activation

*Cost Model*
- Sponsor pays: Cart rental + beans + cups ($1500-3000/day)
- ROI: Cost per lead (e.g., $1500 ÷ 300 leads = $5/lead)
- Compared to: Digital ads $10-50/lead

*Best For*
- B2B companies (trade shows, conferences)
- App launches (QR code downloads)
- Newsletter signups (media companies)

**Strategy 2: Subsidized Coffee (Brand + Revenue)**

*How It Works*
- Coffee sold at discount ($3 vs $5.50 market rate)
- Sponsor subsidizes $2.50/cup
- Guests pay $3, feel they're getting deal

*Cost Model*
- Sponsor pays: Subsidy per cup + cart rental
- Example: 200 cups × $2.50 = $500 subsidy + $800 cart = $1300 total
- Guests perceive value (discounted coffee)

*Best For*
- Coffee brands (showcase own beans)
- Budget-conscious activations
- Longer-duration events (revenue offsets cost)

**Strategy 3: Free Coffee (Pure Brand Play)**

*How It Works*
- 100% free coffee, no strings attached
- Maximum goodwill, positive brand association
- Shareable social media moments (#BrandNameCoffee)

*Cost Model*
- Sponsor pays: All costs (cart + beans + barista)
- Example: $2000/day for 400 cups = $5/cup brand impression
- No direct lead capture, but maximum positive sentiment

*Best For*
- Large brands (Coca-Cola, Google-level budgets)
- Goodwill campaigns (community rebuilding, crisis response)
- Festival sponsorships (mass brand awareness)

**Strategy 4: Product Sampling via Coffee**

*How It Works*
- Coffee cart serves drinks made with sponsored product
- Example: Almond milk brand provides almond milk for all drinks
- Packaging displays product prominently

*Cost Model*
- Product brand provides: Product (beans, milk, etc.)
- Cart service: Standard hire ($600-800)
- Guests taste product in ideal context (expertly prepared)

*Best For*
- Coffee roasters (showcase beans)
- Alternative milk brands (oat milk, almond milk)
- Syrup/flavoring brands (vanilla, caramel)

### Lead Capture & Measurement (450 words)

**Lead Capture Methods**

*QR Code Scanning*
- Most common (COVID accelerated adoption)
- Scan QR → landing page → form → coffee
- Captures: Email, name, phone (optional)
- Integration: Sync to CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)

*Badge Scanning (Conferences/Trade Shows)*
- Conference attendees have scannable badges
- Scan badge → coffee + lead captured
- Data: Name, company, title, contact info

*Social Media Engagement*
- Follow Instagram account → coffee
- Post photo with hashtag → coffee
- Tag 3 friends → coffee
- Difficult to verify (honor system)

*Physical Forms*
- Clipboard signup (old school but works)
- Higher friction (some guests decline)
- Best for: Older demographics less comfortable with digital

**Metrics to Track**

*Quantitative*
- Total cups served (brand impressions)
- Leads captured (email signups, scans)
- Social media posts (#BrandHashtag mentions)
- QR code scans (landing page visits)
- App downloads / product trials

*Qualitative*
- Guest sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- Social media comments (sentiment analysis)
- Brand recall (post-event surveys)

**ROI Calculation**

*Cost Per Impression*
- Total cost ÷ Total cups served
- Example: $2000 ÷ 400 cups = $5/impression

*Cost Per Lead*
- Total cost ÷ Leads captured
- Example: $2000 ÷ 250 leads = $8/lead
- Compare to: Digital ads, event sponsorships

*Lifetime Value Consideration*
- If one lead converts to customer, what's value?
- Example: SaaS product $100/mo, 12-month LTV = $1200
- Even if only 2% convert: 250 leads × 2% × $1200 = $6000 revenue from $2000 activation
- **3x ROI**
