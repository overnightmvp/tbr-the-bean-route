### Profit Margin Calculations (500 words)

**Profit Formula**
```
Profit = Revenue - Direct Costs - (Overhead ÷ Events per month)
```

**Example: Medium Event (70 cups, $600 flat fee)**

**Revenue:** $600

**Direct Costs:**
- Coffee & consumables: $200 (70 cups × $2.85 avg)
- Labor: $0 (you operate, no hired barista)
- Transport: $25

**Total Direct Costs:** $225

**Overhead Allocation** (assuming 12 events/month)
- $900 monthly overhead ÷ 12 events = $75/event

**Profit:** $600 - $225 - $75 = **$300**
**Profit Margin:** $300 ÷ $600 = **50%**

**Scenarios with Hired Barista**

**Same Event, Hired Barista**
- Direct costs: $225 + $140 (barista) = $365
- Overhead: $75
- **Profit: $600 - $365 - $75 = $160 (27% margin)**

**Profit Impact:**
- Solo operation: 45-55% margins
- Hired barista: 20-30% margins
- **Key insight**: Operate yourself initially, hire as you scale

**Annual Income Projections**

**Part-Time (2 events/week, 100 events/year)**
- Average revenue/event: $600
- Average profit/event: $300 (solo operation)
- **Annual profit: $30,000**
- Time commitment: 10-15 hours/week

**Full-Time (4-5 events/week, 200 events/year)**
- Average revenue/event: $650
- Average profit/event: $320
- **Annual profit: $64,000**
- Time commitment: 25-35 hours/week

**Established Business (250 events/year, premium pricing)**
- Average revenue/event: $800
- Average profit/event: $400
- **Annual profit: $100,000**
- Time commitment: 35-45 hours/week
