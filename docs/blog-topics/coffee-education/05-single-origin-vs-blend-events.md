### What is Single-Origin Coffee? (350 words)

**Definition**
- Coffee from one geographic origin (country, region, or farm)
- Examples: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Colombian Huila, Kenyan AA
- Traceable to specific location, harvest, processing method

**Characteristics**
- **Distinct flavor profile**: Terroir-driven (soil, climate, altitude)
- **Seasonal**: Harvest times vary (availability fluctuates)
- **Storytelling**: Farm/region narrative (marketing angle)
- **Price**: Premium ($45-65/kg vs $30-45/kg blends)

**Common Flavor Profiles**
- **Ethiopian**: Fruity, floral, tea-like (jasmine, blueberry notes)
- **Colombian**: Balanced, nutty, chocolate (crowd-pleaser)
- **Kenyan**: Bright, acidic, berry notes (wine-like)
- **Brazilian**: Low acid, chocolatey, nutty (milk drink friendly)
- **Guatemalan**: Cocoa, spice, full-bodied

**Processing Methods (Affect Flavor)**
- **Washed/Wet**: Clean, bright, acidity (showcases origin)
- **Natural/Dry**: Fruity, sweet, bold (fermented complexity)
- **Honey**: Middle ground (some fruit, cleaner than natural)

### What is Blend Coffee? (350 words)

**Definition**
- Combination of beans from multiple origins
- Roaster creates intentional flavor profile
- Examples: "House Blend," "Espresso Blend," "Signature Roast"

**Why Roasters Create Blends**
- **Consistency**: Seasonal variations balanced out
- **Complexity**: Layer flavors (chocolate + fruit + nuts)
- **Forgiving**: Easier to dial in for espresso
- **Cost-effective**: Mix premium + affordable beans

**Blend Composition Examples**

*Classic Espresso Blend*
- 60% Brazilian (base: chocolate, body)
- 30% Colombian (balance: sweetness)
- 10% Ethiopian (complexity: fruity top notes)
- Result: Balanced, sweet, chocolatey with fruit hints

*Milk-Focused Blend*
- 70% Brazilian (chocolate dominates milk drinks)
- 20% Guatemalan (cocoa depth)
- 10% Kenyan (brightness cuts through milk)
- Result: Rich, creamy, stands up to milk

**Blend Advantages**
- **Consistency**: Same taste year-round (seasonality managed by roaster)
- **Versatility**: Works for espresso + milk drinks
- **Forgiving extraction**: Wider margin of error
- **Cost**: Generally $10-20/kg less than single-origin

### Single-Origin for Events: Pros & Cons (500 words)

**Advantages**

**1. Storytelling & Differentiation**
- Guest conversation: "This is from a women-run cooperative in Colombia"
- Marketing: "Serving award-winning Ethiopian Guji"
- Brand positioning: Specialty-focused, quality-conscious
- Instagram content: Farm photos, origin stories, educational posts

**2. Flavor Uniqueness**
- Memorable taste (distinct vs generic)
- Coffee enthusiasts notice and appreciate
- Talking point during service ("Notes of blueberry and jasmine")

**3. Premium Positioning**
- Justifies higher pricing ($6.50-7 vs $5.50-6 lattes)
- Attracts specialty coffee crowd
- Differentiates from competitors (most use blends)

**4. Seasonal Rotation**
- Fresh crop arrivals (marketing moments)
- Menu variety (Kenya in July, Ethiopia in Nov)
- Repeat clients experience newness

**Disadvantages**

**1. Higher Cost**
- $45-65/kg vs $30-45/kg blends
- Impact: Reduce profit margin $0.80-1.20/cup
- Math: 70-cup event = $56-84 less profit

**2. Flavor Risk**
- Not universally loved (some guests prefer chocolatey vs fruity)
- Polarizing profiles (bright acidity not for everyone)
- Learning curve (guests may not "get it")

**3. Consistency Challenges**
- Crop variations (this year's Ethiopian ≠ last year's)
- Availability gaps (between harvests)
- Dial-in changes (each origin extracts differently)

**4. Milk Compatibility**
- Some single-origins muted by milk (delicate flavors lost)
- Light roasts especially (designed for black coffee)
- Customer dissatisfaction if flavor not prominent

**When to Use Single-Origin**
- Premium events (weddings, high-end corporate)
- Coffee-focused events (specialty coffee crowd)
- Small events (easier to dial in, less pressure)
- Brand differentiation strategy (stand out)
- Marketing content creation (storytelling value)

### Blend Coffee for Events: Pros & Cons (500 words)

**Advantages**

**1. Consistency**
- Same flavor month after month (no surprises)
- Guests return to familiar taste (repeat clients)
- Roaster manages seasonal variations (you don't worry)

**2. Versatility**
- Espresso-focused blend: Works for espresso and milk drinks
- Forgiving in milk (chocolate/nut flavors come through)
- Crowd-pleasing (designed for broad appeal)

**3. Easier Dial-In**
- Forgiving extraction (wider sweet spot)
- Less finicky (grind/temp adjustments minor)
- Less waste (fewer shots discarded during dialing in)

**4. Cost-Effective**
- $30-45/kg vs $45-65/kg single-origin
- Better margins: +$0.80-1.20/cup
- Volume pricing (larger orders cheaper)

**5. Reliability**
- Always available (roasters stock year-round)
- No seasonal gaps (blends don't run out)
- Backup options (if roaster out, switch blend easily)

**Disadvantages**

**1. Less Unique**
- Generic taste (competitors likely use similar blends)
- Harder to differentiate brand
- Limited storytelling (no farm narrative)

**2. Perceived as Lower Quality**
- Specialty crowd may judge (blend = commercial, not specialty)
- Premium events expect single-origin
- Marketing challenge (harder to position as premium)

**3. Less Marketing Content**
- Fewer Instagram stories (no origin trip photos)
- Less educational angle
- Blend name alone not compelling

**When to Use Blend**
- High-volume events (80+ cups, consistency critical)
- Corporate events (functional coffee, not experience-focused)
- Budget-conscious clients (pass savings to client or keep margin)
- New vendors (forgiving as you perfect technique)
- Festivals/markets (speed + consistency priority)

### Hybrid Strategy: Best of Both Worlds (400 words)

**Option 1: Rotate by Event Type**
- **Weddings**: Single-origin (premium, storytelling)
- **Corporate**: Blend (consistency, speed)
- **Private parties**: Blend (cost-effective)
- **Festivals**: Blend (volume, reliability)

**Option 2: Seasonal Single-Origin, Fallback Blend**
- Stock: Single-origin as primary (showcase)
- Backup: Blend for if single-origin runs out or doesn't dial in
- Flexibility: Choose day-of based on mood/event

**Option 3: Dual Menu**
- Offer: Regular drinks (blend) + Premium drinks (single-origin)
- Pricing: Blend lattes $5.50, Single-origin lattes $6.50
- Guest choice: Budget vs specialty
- Reality: Too complex for mobile events (slows service)

**Option 4: Single-Origin Filter, Blend Espresso**
- If offering: Filter/pour-over (single-origin showcase)
- Espresso drinks: Blend (milk-friendly)
- Best of both: Specialty credentials + consistency

**Recommendation for New Vendors**
- **Year 1**: Start with quality blend (consistency, forgiving, cost-effective)
- **Year 2**: Introduce single-origin for weddings (test premium positioning)
- **Year 3+**: Choose based on brand identity (premium vs volume)

### Coffee Selection by Event Type (400 words)

**Questions to Ask Roaster**

**Taste Before Buying**

- Test: Dial in at home, taste in milk
- Decide: Does it fit your brand and equipment?

### Dialing In: Single-Origin vs Blend (300 words)

**Blend Dial-In**
- Easier: Wider extraction sweet spot
- Forgiving: +/- 1-2g dose, +/- 2-3 sec extraction still tastes good
- Stable: Less affected by grinder drift
- Time to dial: 5-10 shots typically

**Single-Origin Dial-In**
- Finicky: Narrow sweet spot (precise dose, time, temp required)
- Sensitive: 1g dose change noticeable
- Varies: Each origin different (Ethiopian ≠ Colombian)
- Time to dial: 10-20 shots (more waste)

**Event Day Dialing**
- Arrive early: 60-90 min before service
- Dial in: Pull 5-10 shots, adjust grind
- Taste: Ensure balanced extraction
- Single-origin: Extra time needed (factor into schedule)

**Environmental Factors**
- Heat: Summer heat affects machine temp (dial drifts)
- Humidity: Beans absorb moisture (grind changes)
- Altitude: Pressure changes (minimal for Melbourne)
- Single-origin: More affected than blends

### Cost Analysis (300 words)

**Blend Cost Per Cup**
- Beans: 18g per double shot = $0.54-0.81/cup ($30-45/kg)
- Milk (latte): $0.60
- Cup/lid: $0.40
- **Total: $1.54-1.81/cup**

**Single-Origin Cost Per Cup**
- Beans: 18g per double shot = $0.81-1.17/cup ($45-65/kg)
- Milk (latte): $0.60
- Cup/lid: $0.40
- **Total: $1.81-2.17/cup**

**Profit Impact (70-cup event)**
- Blend: ($5.50 price - $1.81 cost) × 70 = **$258 profit**
- Single-origin: ($6.50 price - $2.17 cost) × 70 = **$303 profit**
- **Difference: +$45** if premium pricing accepted

**When Single-Origin Increases Profit**
- If clients pay premium (+$1/cup) for single-origin = +$45 profit/event
- If clients won't pay premium = -$25 profit/event (cost increase, same price)
- **Key**: Must communicate value (justify premium)
