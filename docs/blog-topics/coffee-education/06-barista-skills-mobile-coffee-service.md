### Technical Coffee Skills (600 words)

**Espresso Extraction Mastery**

*Dosing Consistency*
- Target dose: 18-20g for double shot (depends on basket)
- Variance allowed: ±0.5g max (affects flavor)
- Tool: Dosing scale (essential for mobile cart)
- Practice: 50+ shots to build muscle memory

*Tamping Technique*
- Pressure: 15kg / 30lbs (firm, consistent)
- Level: Flat, even compression (no channeling)
- Tool: Quality tamper (58mm for most machines)
- Common error: Angled tamp (causes uneven extraction)

*Dial-In Speed*
- Event morning: 30 min to dial in (test shots, adjust grind)
- Mid-event: Recognize under/over extraction quickly
- Adjustment: Make micro-adjustments without wasting 10+ shots
- Experience: After 100+ events, dial-in becomes intuitive

*Shot Quality Assessment*
- Visual: Honey-like consistency, tiger striping (crema)
- Taste: Balanced (not sour = under-extracted, not bitter = over-extracted)
- Time: 25-30 seconds for double shot (guideline, not rule)

**Milk Texturing & Latte Art**

*Steaming Technique*
- Temperature: 55-65°C (140-150°F) optimal
- Texture: Microfoam (velvety, no large bubbles)
- Sound: "Paper tearing" sound during stretching phase
- Time: 30-45 seconds per jug (don't overheat)

*Milk Jug Sizes*
- Small (350mL): Single drink, less waste
- Medium (600mL): Most common (lattes, cappuccinos)
- Large (1L): Back-to-back drinks, faster service
- Strategy: Use larger jug during peak rush (efficiency)

*Latte Art (Essential or Not?)*
- **Pro**: Impressive, photo-worthy, differentiates brand
- **Con**: Slows service (15-30 sec per drink)
- **Verdict**: Simple pour (heart or tulip, 10 sec) = sweet spot
- **Skip**: Complex art at high-volume events (speed matters more)

*Alternative Milk Challenges*
- Oat milk: Steams well (similar to dairy)
- Almond milk: Separates easily (lower temp, gentle steam)
- Soy milk: Curdles if too hot (<60°C essential)
- Practice: Each behaves differently (master all)

**Grinder Management**

*Grind Size Adjustment*
- Too fine: Slow extraction, bitter, channeling
- Too coarse: Fast extraction, sour, weak
- Adjustment: Small increments (half-step changes)
- Frequency: Check every 20-30 shots (grinder drift)

*Grinder Cleaning*
- Purge: First 1-2 doses after grinding change (stale grounds)
- Daily: Vacuum chamber, wipe burrs
- Event-to-event: Clean if switching beans

**Workflow & Speed Optimization**

*Queue Management*
- Take orders while pulling shots (multitask)
- Batch milk steaming (steam for 2-3 drinks at once)
- Pre-dose portafilters (during quiet moments)
- Communicate: Tell guest their drink name when ready (no shouting confusion)

*Peak Capacity*
- Solo barista: 60-80 cups/hour (optimal conditions)
- Dual barista: 120-160 cups/hour (coordinated workflow)
- Bottlenecks: Milk steaming (biggest limiter), espresso extraction (second)

*Error Recovery*
- Spilled shot: Apologize, remake immediately (don't dwell)
- Wrong drink: Offer to adjust or remake (goodwill gesture)
- Machine issue: Communicate delay, offer alternatives

### Customer Service & Communication (500 words)

**Guest Interaction**

*Greeting & Welcome*
- Smile essential (first impression)
- Eye contact (acknowledges guest)
- Warm greeting: "Hi! What can I get for you today?"
- Energy level: Match event vibe (subdued for formal, upbeat for casual)

*Order Taking*
- Listen carefully (repeat order for confirmation)
- Prompt for size: "Regular or large?"
- Suggest: "Have you tried our [signature drink]?"
- Dietary needs: Proactively ask "Milk preference?"

*Education & Engagement*
- Explain origin (if single-origin): "This is from Colombia, notes of chocolate and caramel"
- Process questions: "How do you make a flat white vs latte?"
- Equipment: "This is a La Marzocco machine, same as top Melbourne cafés"
- Balance: Engage without slowing line

**Managing Difficult Situations**

*Complaints About Coffee*
- Listen: Don't defend immediately
- Apologize: "I'm sorry it's not to your taste"
- Offer: Remake, adjust, or different drink
- Learn: If multiple complaints, check extraction

*Long Queue Frustration*
- Acknowledge: "Thanks for your patience"
- Communicate: "About 5-minute wait" (set expectations)
- Speed up: Simplify menu temporarily ("Focusing on lattes and long blacks for faster service")

*Dietary Restrictions*
- Allergies: Take seriously (nut allergies if almond milk cross-contamination)
- Vegan: Confirm oat/almond milk, no honey
- Pregnancy: Offer decaf (proactively)

**Professionalism**

*Appearance*
