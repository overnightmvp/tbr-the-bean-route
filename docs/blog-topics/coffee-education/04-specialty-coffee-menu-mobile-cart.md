### Menu Design Principles (500 words)

**Speed vs Complexity Trade-Off**

**Fast Menu (60-80 cups/hour)**
- Core 8 drinks only
- No syrups, no cold brew
- Standard sizes
- Best for: Large events, tight timelines, festivals

**Balanced Menu (50-60 cups/hour)**
- Core 8 + iced drinks + 2-3 syrups
- Most events fall here
- Flexibility without overwhelming

**Extensive Menu (30-40 cups/hour)**
- Everything + seasonal + signature + dessert drinks
- Best for: Small events, markets (guests browse), premium pricing
- Risk: Slow service = long queues

**Recommendation**: Start with balanced menu, adjust based on event type.

**Menu Board Design**

**Essential Info**
- Drink names + sizes + prices (clear, large font)
- Milk alternatives available
- "Decaf available" note
- Seasonal special highlighted

**Layout**
- Top: Espresso drinks (most popular)
- Middle: Specialty/cold drinks
- Bottom: Non-coffee (tea, hot choc)
- Right side: Prices clearly aligned

**Visual Design**
- Chalkboard: Rustic, changeable, on-brand for coffee carts
- Printed: Professional, weather-proof, harder to update
- Digital: Premium, easily updated, requires power/setup

**Menu Psychology**
- **Anchoring**: List premium drink first (makes $5.50 latte seem reasonable)
- **Highlighting**: Box or star the signature drink (drives orders)
- **Limited options**: Don't overwhelm (8-12 drinks max)

**Verbal Menu**
- Quick pitch: "We have lattes, cappuccinos, flat whites, long blacks, and iced drinks. All available with oat, almond, or soy milk."
- Prompt: "Our house specialty is [signature drink], would you like to try?"

### Pricing Strategy (450 words)

**Market Rates (Melbourne 2026)**
- Espresso: $3.50-4.50
- Long black: $4-5
- Latte/cappuccino/flat white: $5-6
- Specialty (mocha, iced): $5.50-7
- Cold brew: $6-7

**Pricing Considerations**

**Event Type**
- **Weddings**: Premium pricing ($6-7 lattes) — clients expect quality
- **Corporate**: Standard pricing ($5.50-6.50) — professional but fair
- **Private parties**: Standard pricing ($5-6) — balance value + profit
- **Festivals**: Slightly higher ($6-7) — convenience premium, captive audience

**Flat Fee vs Per-Cup**
- **Flat fee events**: Price drinks at $0 (included in event fee)
- **Markets/festivals**: Charge per cup (revenue model)
- **Hybrid**: Corporate office (employer subsidizes, employees pay $3)

**Alternative Milk Upcharge?**
- **Included**: Goodwill gesture, simplifies ordering, modern expectation
- **+$0.50-1**: Extra cost to you ($0.30-0.50/cup), pass through
- **Trend**: Increasingly included (Melbourne standard now)
- **Recommendation**: Include for first 3 years (build reputation), consider upcharge later if costs rise

**Specialty Drink Pricing**
- **Cost-plus method**: Cost of ingredients × 3-4 = price
- **Example**: Cold brew (cost $2.20) × 3 = $6.60 price
- **Premium positioning**: Signature drink +$1-2 above standard latte

**Size Pricing**
- Small (8oz): -$0.50 (less milk, less coffee sometimes)
- Regular (12oz): Standard price
- Large (16oz): +$0.50-1 (extra milk, extra shot)

### Sourcing Quality Beans (400 words)

**Bean Selection Matters**

**Single-Origin vs Blend**
- **Single-origin**: Showcase specific region (Ethiopia, Colombia, etc.)
  - Pro: Unique flavor profile, story to tell, specialty appeal
  - Con: More expensive ($40-60/kg vs $30-45/kg)
  - Best for: Premium branding, coffee enthusiast events
- **Blend**: Balanced, consistent, forgiving
  - Pro: Easier to dial in, cost-effective, crowd-pleasing
  - Con: Less distinctive, harder to market
  - Best for: High-volume events, consistent quality priority

**Roast Level**
- **Medium roast**: Most versatile (espresso + milk drinks)
- **Dark roast**: Traditional, chocolatey, less acidity (older demographics)
- **Light roast**: Specialty, fruity, acidic (coffee geeks)
- **Recommendation**: Medium roast blend for events (pleases 90% of guests)

**Melbourne Roasters to Consider**
- **Specialty**: Seven Seeds, Market Lane, Proud Mary ($45-60/kg)
- **Mid-range**: Mecca Coffee, ST. ALi, Axil ($38-50/kg)
- **Value**: Vittoria, Lavazza, Grinders ($25-40/kg)
- **Strategy**: Start mid-range (quality without premium cost), upgrade as you raise prices

**Bean Freshness**
- Roast date: Use within 4-6 weeks for espresso
- Storage: Airtight container, cool, dark
- Order frequency: Weekly or bi-weekly (don't over-stock)

**Roaster Partnerships**
- **Co-branding**: Display roaster's name (free beans or discount)
- **Wholesale pricing**: Save 10-30% (buy direct vs retail)
- **Training**: Some roasters offer barista training (relationship building)

### Menu Testing & Refinement (300 words)

**Track Your Orders**
- Note: Most/least popular drinks per event
- Data: After 10-20 events, clear patterns emerge
- Example: If mocha orders <3%, consider removing

**Guest Feedback**
- Ask: "How's the coffee?"
- Observe: Facial expressions, repeat orders
- Adjust: Grind, milk temp, ratios based on feedback

**Seasonal Adjustments**
- Summer menu: 50% iced drinks (have cold brew ready)
- Winter menu: 95% hot drinks (minimal iced demand)
- Transition: Sept-Nov and Mar-May (balanced menu)

**Event-Specific Menus**
- **Corporate breakfast**: 80% long blacks + lattes (simple, fast)
- **Wedding cocktail hour**: 40% iced, 40% lattes, 20% specialty
- **Kids' party**: Stock extra hot chocolate, babycinos
- **Evening event**: Consider chai latte, decaf (not full caffeine load)

**Simplify When Overwhelmed**
- If queues >15 min: Temporarily cut specialty drinks
- Announce: "For faster service, we're focusing on our core menu"
- Better: Fast simple drinks than slow extensive menu
