# 📋 TBR Agile Backlog — Epic Roadmap

This is the centralized source of truth for all current and future work on The Bean Route.

---

## 🔴 Epic 1: Launch Security & Stability (Priority: Urgent)
*Goal: Fix the "brutal" audit holes before real users touch the site.*

- [x] **Consolidate Documentation**: Move all project artifacts into this Agile Hub.
- [x] **Admin Session Hardening**: Move OTP codes to DB and implement signed cookies.
- [x] **Database RLS Policies**: Lock down `quotes`, `jobs`, and `applications`.
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Protect inquiry and registration forms from spam.
- [x] **Zod Validation**: Implement server-side schema validation for all POST routes.

## 🟡 Epic 2: Core Conversion Optimization (Priority: High)
*Goal: Improve the onboarding and booking rates.*

**Completed:**
- [x] **UI Component Naming Standardization**: Standardized component file casing (button.tsx, card.tsx, etc.) to fix webpack warnings on case-insensitive filesystems.
- [x] **formatDate Utility Function**: Added missing `formatDate` export to `@/lib/utils.ts` for dashboard date formatting.

**Pending:**
- [ ] **Vendor Image Support**: Allow vendors to upload at least one "hero" image during registration.
- [ ] **Job Management Link**: Send a secure "Manage Job" link to customers via email (since there are no accounts yet).
- [ ] **Submission Previews**: Allow users to see how their listing/job looks before final submit.
- [ ] **Location Autocomplete**: Integrate Google Places API for consistent location data.

## 🟢 Epic 3: Vendor Success & Growth (Priority: Medium)
*Goal: Make the platform valuable for vendors to stick around.*

- [ ] **Vendor Dashboard**: Let approved vendors log in and manage their profile/inquiries.
- [ ] **Quote Success Tracking**: Show vendors how many of their quotes are being viewed/accepted.
- [ ] **Review System**: Allow planners to leave feedback on vendor performance.
