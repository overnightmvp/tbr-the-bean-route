## Understanding Greek Coffee Service

For event organizers unfamiliar with Greek coffee, here's what to expect when booking Roaming Roasters:

**What is Greek Coffee?**
Traditional Greek coffee (Ellinikós kafés) is prepared in a briki (small pot), creating a strong, unfiltered coffee served in small cups. The coffee grounds settle at the bottom—don't drink them!

**Service Considerations:**
- **Preparation time:** Slightly slower than espresso (important for capacity planning)
- **Serving style:** Small cups, often served with water and sometimes a sweet treat
- **Guest education:** Baristas can explain preparation method and tradition to curious guests
- **Equipment:** Requires special briki pots and heat source (gas burner typically)

**When to Offer Greek Coffee:**
- Greek cultural festivals and community events
- Greek Orthodox church functions
- Family gatherings in Greek-Australian communities
- Multicultural events celebrating diverse coffee traditions
- Corporate diversity and inclusion events

**Guest Reception:**
Most Australian guests appreciate experiencing authentic Greek coffee as cultural education. Roaming Roasters' baristas handle both Greek coffee traditionalists and curious first-timers with equal expertise.
