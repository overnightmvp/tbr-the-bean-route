# Coffee Cart Marketplace — System Audit & Backlog

**Date:** 2026-02-04 (Updated: E2 Complete)
**Status:** Phase 3 (Real Vendor Data) ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

System has completed Phase 0 (Cleanup), Phase 1 (E3 - Protect Admin), Phase 2 (E1 - Email Notifications), and Phase 3 (E2 - Real Vendor Data). The marketplace is now fully functional with database-driven vendors, complete email notifications, and admin authentication. Admin verification codes now send via email with whitelist support. Next: Phase 4 (E5 - Quote Acceptance) to enable job owners to accept quotes and complete the booking funnel.

## 1. Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Completed

| Component | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Next.js 14.2.5 | ✅ Configured | App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind |
| Supabase Client | ✅ Configured | `src/lib/supabase.ts` — anon key client |
| Supabase Admin | ✅ Configured | `src/lib/supabase-admin.ts` — service role |
| Admin Auth | ✅ Complete | Email + code verification, HTTP-only cookies |
| Email Library | ✅ Installed | `@getbrevo/brevo` package added |
| Email Utility | ✅ Created | `src/lib/email.ts` with sendEmail() |

###⚠️ Requires Configuration

| Component | Required | Location | How to Configure |
|---|---|---|---|
| SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY | Server-side admin operations | `.env.local` | Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → service_role (secret!) |
| BREVO_API_KEY | Email sending | `.env.local` | https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api |
| Database Tables | Inquiries, vendors, jobs, quotes, applications | Supabase SQL editor | Run `docs/supabase-schema.sql` (create if missing) |

### 🔍 Status Check Commands

```bash
# Check if Supabase client works (from browser console on /app page)
localStorage  # Should see no Supabase errors in console

# Check if admin auth works
# 1. Go to /admin
# 2. Enter your email
# 3. Check server logs for 6-digit code
# 4. Enter code → should reach admin dashboard

# Check if email utility loads (won't send without API key)
# Server logs during build should show:
# "BREVO_API_KEY not configured. Email sending will be skipped."
```

### Epic 2: Real Vendor Data
**Goal:** Replace hardcoded vendors with database-driven marketplace
**Business Value:** Scalable vendor management, admin can approve new vendors
**Dependencies:** Supabase configured, vendors table exists

#### User Stories

**Story E2.1 — Browse from Database** ✅ DONE (Commit: cc5ce72)
```
As an event planner
I want to see real vendors who have been approved by the admin
So I can book actual available coffee carts

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] /app page fetches vendors from Supabase instead of hardcoded array
- [x] Only shows vendors with status = 'active' (not pending/rejected applications)
- [x] Same filter UI (suburbs, capacity, price) works with DB data
- [x] Same card rendering (business name, specialty, price range)
- [x] Loading state while fetching

Technical Notes:
- Homepage now fetches from Supabase vendors table
- Filter logic stays client-side (small dataset)
- Uses Vendor type from supabase.ts (matches DB schema)
```

**Story E2.2 — Approve Creates Vendor** ✅ DONE (Commit: 8dffa4c)
```
As an admin
I want vendor applications to automatically create vendor listings when approved
So I don't have to manually duplicate data

```
As a developer
I want to remove vendors.ts and migrate to DB-only
So we have a single source of truth

Acceptance Criteria:

## 5. Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Email Notifications (E1)
**If:** Brevo is configured and you want to complete the notification system

1. Complete E1-2 (planner confirmation) — already coded, just merge
2. Build E1-3 & E1-4 (quote notifications) — ~15 min
3. Build E1-5 (applicant decision) — ~10 min
4. Test all email flows end-to-end

**Time:** ~30 minutes
**Outcome:** Complete notification system

### Option B: Real Vendor Data (E2)
**If:** Supabase is configured and you want dynamic marketplace

1. Ensure vendors table exists in Supabase
2. Build E2-1 (browse from DB) — ~15 min
3. Build E2-2 (approve creates vendor) — ~15 min
4. Build E2-3 & E2-4 (vendor detail + cleanup) — ~20 min
5. Optionally seed 6 hardcoded vendors into DB

**Time:** ~50 minutes
**Outcome:** Scalable vendor management

### Option C: Infrastructure Setup First
**If:** You're unsure if Supabase/Brevo are configured

1. Create Supabase project (if not exists)
2. Run schema SQL to create all tables
3. Get Supabase service role key → `.env.local`
4. Create Brevo account, get API key → `.env.local`
5. Test inquiry submission end-to-end
6. Verify emails send (or log correctly if no API key)

**Time:** ~20 minutes
**Outcome:** Verified working infrastructure

## 6. Current Branch Status

```
Branch: e1-2-planner-inquiry-confirm
Status: In progress, code written, build attempted
Issue: Build error (turbopack module not found - likely transient)
Recommendation: Clean build and retry, or stash and start fresh
```

### Recovery Steps

```bash
# Option 1: Clean rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build

# Option 2: Stash current work
git stash
git checkout main
git branch -D e1-2-planner-inquiry-confirm

# Option 3: Force complete current work
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(email): Add planner inquiry confirmation email"
git checkout main
git merge e1-2-planner-inquiry-confirm
npm run build  # Verify clean build on main
```

## 7. Known Issues & Technical Debt

| Issue | Impact | Priority | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded vendors with null emails | E1-1 notifications don't send | Low (MVP) | Fixed when E2 completes |
| Browserslist outdated | Build warning | Low | Run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` |
| Storybook lint warning | Build noise | Low | Add rule override or fix export name |
| Turbopack error (transient) | Build occasionally fails | Medium | Clean rebuild usually fixes |
| No integration tests | Manual testing required | Low (pre-PMF) | Add after PMF |
| npm audit: 19 vulnerabilities | Security warnings | Low | Run `npm audit fix` when safe |

---

## 8. Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

Once system is live, track:

- **Inquiry conversion rate:** Inquiries submitted → vendor responses
- **Quote acceptance rate:** Quotes submitted → quotes accepted
- **Application approval rate:** Applications → approved vendors
- **Email deliverability:** Sent → delivered (Brevo dashboard)
- **Time to first vendor response:** Inquiry submitted → vendor replies
