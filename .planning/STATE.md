# The Bean Route: Project State

## Project Reference

**Building:** The Bean Route — 90-day coffee culture and marketplace authority hub with blog, internal linking strategy, SEO optimization, and free coffee growth loop.

**Core Value:** Drive organic discovery and vendor acquisition through high-intent content.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 02-Design-System-UX
**Current Plan:** 4 of 5 (mobile flows optimized)
**Status:** Executing Phase 2 plans

**Progress:** [█████████░] 89%

## Recent Decisions

### Phase 2: Design System & UX Optimization (ACTIVE - Days 31-40)
- **shadcn/ui strategy:** Tailwind config approach (not CSS variables) for light-mode-only Phase 2 - simpler, defer dark mode to Phase 5
- **Input height h-12 (48px):** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (44px minimum + 4px margin) for all touch targets
- **Button lg size h-12 (48px):** Updated from h-10 for WCAG compliance and consistent touch targets
- **Flow diagrams:** Markdown + Mermaid (version-controlled) vs Figma - no external dependencies, git-trackable
- **Flow priorities:** Vendor registration (mobile broken) → Event organizer inquiry (mobile broken)
- **Focus areas:** Visual clarity, mobile optimization, form friction reduction, flow diagrams
- **Onboarding fixes:** Landing page clarity (mission/value/CTA/proof), post-reg gaps (feedback/approval/next steps)
- **Testing:** E2E (Playwright) focus on critical flows, form validation, mobile responsiveness
- **Modal success state:** Chosen over page redirect for faster feedback and better UX with confetti
- **24-48 hour approval timeline:** Explicitly stated in success modal to set clear expectations
- **Single-step form with sticky footer:** Keep SimpleBookingModal single-step (defer multi-step to Phase 3) - simpler, faster execution, sticky footer achieves mobile UX goals
- **Skip FormField pattern:** Use Label + manual error display instead of react-hook-form FormField - consistent with existing validation approach, no new dependencies

### Phase 1: Content Strategy (Confirmed)
- Payload CMS selected for blog backend (allows non-dev publishing)
- 90-post strategy: 30 venue spotlights, 20 location guides, 15 how-to guides, 25 coffee education
- Geographic phases: Days 1-30 (Chadstone), 31-40 (design system), 41-70 (Knox expansion), 71-90 (broader coverage)
- 1 post per day target for consistent SEO signal
- AI-assisted production with human refinement
- Free coffee incentive model for vendor acquisition
- **Phase 01:** RichTextRenderer already exists - no implementation needed (pre-existing work)
- **Phase 01:** 8/10 venues need verification - documented research gaps and next steps
- **Phase 01 Plan 02:** Markdown-first workflow for content (draft → review → publish) improves quality control
- **Phase 01 Plan 02:** 10 venue spotlight posts drafted (2 verified, 8 pending), ready for Payload CMS entry
- **Phase 01 Plan 03:** 7 location guide posts drafted (15,074 words) covering Chadstone + 5 adjacent suburbs
- **Phase 01 Plan 03:** Geographic clustering strategy (hub-spoke model) establishes parent-child SEO topology
- **Phase 01 Plan 03:** Roundup content format (3-10 vendors per guide) maximizes internal linking density (~43 links)

## Blockers & Concerns

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Identified Risks:**
- **Venue Verification Gap:** Only 2/10 venues verified for spotlight posts (need 5+ minimum)
- **Venue Permissions:** Need to contact venues for permission before publishing spotlights
- **Geographic Scope:** Chadstone area may have limited mobile cart coverage, may need to expand suburbs

**Mitigations:**
- Complete Google Maps + Instagram research before Plan 01-02
- Create vendor outreach email template
- Expand to Box Hill, Monash, Wheelers Hill if needed

## Pending Todos

None currently tracked. Todos should be created when roadmap is broken into phases.
