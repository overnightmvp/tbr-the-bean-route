## Problem

30 blog topics have been researched and outlined with comprehensive metadata (SEO keywords, outlines, internal linking strategy, conversion optimization). These topics are production-ready but need to be written and published to drive organic traffic and establish TBR as Melbourne's coffee cart marketplace authority.

Current state:
- 31 markdown files created (20 event-focused + 10 coffee-education + 1 strategy doc)
- Each topic has 3000-4000 word outline
- Prioritized by difficulty, traffic potential, and strategic value
- Internal linking strategy defined
- Quick wins identified (topics 1-8 for weeks 1-4)

These blog posts will:
1. Drive event organizer traffic to vendor directory (customer acquisition)
2. Attract vendors to TBR platform (supply-side growth)
3. Establish SEO authority for "coffee cart hire melbourne" keywords
4. Build brand credibility through expertise

## Solution

Follow the content strategy roadmap in `CONTENT-STRATEGY.md`:

**Phase 1 - Quick Wins (Weeks 1-4):**
Write 8 high-priority topics first:
1. Coffee Cart Hire Melbourne Pricing Guide (event-focused/01)
2. How to Hire Coffee Cart Corporate Events (event-focused/02)
3. Top 10 Mobile Coffee Carts Melbourne (event-focused/03)
4. Coffee Cart vs Barista Station (event-focused/05)
5. How to Start Mobile Coffee Cart Business Melbourne (coffee-education/01)
6. Coffee Cart Wedding Melbourne Guide (event-focused/04)
7. Coffee Cart Setup Requirements (event-focused/06)
8. Coffee Cart Capacity Calculator (event-focused/08)

**Phase 2 - Authority Building (Weeks 5-8):**
Write 5 authority topics for expertise building

**Phase 3 - Complete Ecosystem (Weeks 9-24):**
Write remaining 17 topics to cover all bases

**Implementation steps per article:**
1. Expand outline to full 3000-4000 word article
2. Add SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)
3. Create/source images (coffee cart photos, infographics)
4. Optimize for Melbourne local SEO (suburbs, venues, roasters)
5. Add internal links (vendor directory CTAs, cross-linking)
6. Publish to `/docs/blog/` or CMS
7. Promote (social media, email newsletter, vendor community)

**Success metrics:**
- Month 3: 1,000 organic visitors/month
- Month 6: 5,000 organic visitors/month
- Month 12: 15,000+ organic visitors/month
- 2-5% inquiry form submission rate
- 10-20% vendor directory click rate

**Tools/resources needed:**
- CMS or static site generator (Astro/Next.js based on tech stack)
- Stock photos or photographer (coffee cart imagery)
- SEO tools (analytics, keyword tracking)
- Social media scheduler

**Annual updates:**
- Pricing Guide (annually)
- Coffee Trends (annually with year in title)
- Seasonal Considerations (quarterly)
